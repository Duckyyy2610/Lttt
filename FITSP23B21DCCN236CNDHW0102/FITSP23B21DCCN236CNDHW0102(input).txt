Test case 1:
NIIGATA, Japan -- Group of Seven finance ministers will take measures to prevent future bank failures like that of
based Silicon Valley Bank in the U.S., according to a draft of their final statement to be released on Saturday,
Nikkei has learned.The bloc's finance chiefs and central bank governors, who are wrapping up a three-day meeting,
will also reaffirm that "our financial system is resilient," noting the effectiveness of regulatory reforms
implemented after the 2008 global financial crisis.However, the group's planned statement will also point to a
need to "address data, supervisory and regulatory gaps in the banking system."Depositors rushed to pull their
savings out of Silicon Valley Bank, which collapsed in March, underscoring the threat of bank runs. It was one of
several U.S. lenders to have collapsed recently.Measures designed to prevent a repeat have been on the agenda for
discussion at the G-7 meeting in the Japanese city of Niigata.The Financial Stability Board, an international body
including banking authorities from major countries, is analyzing problems that led to the banking turmoil. The G-7
will stress support for the body's ongoing efforts to "draw out lessons learned from the recent episodes," the draft said.
Test case 2:
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil)
by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
Test case 3:
There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some
form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a
passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.
All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first
true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model
sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always
free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
Test case 4:
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at
its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed
to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and
web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many
web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
purpose (injected humour and the like).
Test case 5:
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make
a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
of Lorem Ipsum.
