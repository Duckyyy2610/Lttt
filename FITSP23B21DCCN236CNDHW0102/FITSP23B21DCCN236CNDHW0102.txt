NIIGATA, Japan -- Group of Seven finance ministers will take measures to prevent future bank failures like that of based Silicon Valley Bank in the U.S., according to a draft of their final statement to be released on Saturday, Nikkei has learned.
The bloc's finance chiefs and central bank governors, who are wrapping up a three-day meeting, will also reaffirm that "our financial system is resilient," noting the effectiveness of regulatory reforms implemented after the 2008 global financial crisis.
However, the group's planned statement will also point to a need to "address data, supervisory and regulatory gaps in the banking system."
Depositors rushed to pull their savings out of Silicon Valley Bank, which collapsed in March, underscoring the threat of bank runs. It was one of several U.S. lenders to have collapsed recently.
Measures designed to prevent a repeat have been on the agenda for discussion at the G-7 meeting in the Japanese city of Niigata.
The Financial Stability Board, an international body including banking authorities from major countries, is analyzing problems that led to the banking turmoil. The G-7 will stress support for the body's ongoing efforts to "draw out lessons learned from the recent episodes," the draft said.
